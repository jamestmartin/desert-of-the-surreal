* Tarskian model-theoretical semantics for exactly or approximately classical proof systems; T-schema as a metamathematical version of the principle of reflexivity.
* Korbynski anti-model-theoretical semantics for exactly or approximately classical refutation systems; "Map is not the territory" as a metamathematical version of the refutational principle of reflexivity.

* Equational theories are to Tarskian systems as inequational theories are to non-Tarskian systems.
* Deleuzian identity vs difference; Derrida différance and deconstruction as anti-model-theoretical references for refutation systems.
* Anekantavada, Syadvada (non-classical systems of uniformally positive assertion); Acinteyya, Acatalepsy, Catuṣkoṭi, śūnyatavāda (non-classical systems of unformally positive refutation)

* Practically, the left hand side of the Sambin cube concerns Tarskian or Kripke model theoretical semantics as primary with refutations secondary or omitted entirely.
* The right hand side of the Sambin cube concerns anti-Tarskian or anti-Kripke model theoretical semantics; non-classical and paraconsistent Korbynski semantics and refutation systems become primary with proofs and models secondary or omitted.
* There exist systems as yet not described in the Sambin cube, and there exist systems that are perhaps not representable in a faithful/standard sequent calculus as subtensions or extension of Sambin's basic.
