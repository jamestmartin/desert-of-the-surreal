# U & Under B

> OH. Just got that you're talking about messing with distributivity here. That's what the system U deals with. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kiarash-Rahmani/publication/266560337_A_Proof_of_Cut-Elimination_Theorem_for_U_Logic/links/54c3514e0cf256ed5a9117dc/A-Proof-of-Cut-Elimination-Theorem-for-U-Logic.pdf

## Proof Search
so the provability predicate is a godel sort of encoding, and by breaking modus ponens you break functional completeness so you can't express the provability predicate?

so I recognize that you have some sort of notion of computation in terms of internalized cuts or something which is on my (large) todo list of things to understand, but it's not clear to me how it relates to the type-theoretic view. my best guess so far is that it corresponds with logic programming languages and solving unifications as opposed to functional programming languages, or perhaps to some sort of internalized eval-like function.

from a functional point of view, any of the logics contain precisely zero interesting computation until you start adding inductive types. a language based on constraint solving might be computationally more interesting than that; I'm not sure.

a truth predicate would reflect model-specific reasoning whereas a provability predicate would not?

without modus ponens proof search becomes decidable? is that it?

because the liar's paradox would present an infinite loop for proof search, effectively.

part of the hard part is knowing how many times to apply functions in the context? and sans-functions, maybe you can tell whether your proof is structurally larger than the desired conclusion?

> For classical systems and any system which meets the minimum conditions for GÃ¶del's proof, proof and truth will be separable concepts. There will be things expressible in the system and by the rules of the system which are neither provable nor refutable in that system.
