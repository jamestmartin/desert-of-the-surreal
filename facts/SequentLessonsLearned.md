Negations can be contextual or context-free.
Negations can be paraconsistent or paracomplete, xor classical.
Negations can be additive or multiplicative.
Negations can be term negations or context negations.
Negations can be context-eliminating or non-context-eliminating.
Negations can have positive or negative polarity.
Negations can be object language negations or metanegations.

Excluded Middle multiplies with the number of negations and divisions of connectives into additive, multiplicative, and exponential varieties.
Non-contradiction multiplies with the number of negations and divisions of connectives into additive, multiplicative, and exponential varieties.
Those multiplicities are mirrored in generally independent versions of the principles on the opposite side of the sequent.

Inclusions and exclusions (hereafter generally referred to as "implications") correspond with Excluded-Middle, Non-contradiction, Excluded-Middle', or Non-contradiction'.
In proof systems, exclusions correspond with Non-contradiction', and inclusions correspond with Excluded-Middle.

Refutation is not generally interdefinable with the corresponding proof systems's notion of negation(s).
