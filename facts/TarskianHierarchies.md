# Tarski Hierarchies of Languages
The hierarchies of languages correspond to a rejection of one or more of the four conditions outlined in Tarski's investigations of the definability of truth:
* The languages are consistent
* The languages are semantically closed.
* The ordinary (classical) rules of logic hold for the languages.
* The languages have some mechanism allowing self-reference.

## Classical Hierarchies of Languages
In the literature, the two kinds of hierarchy that are explicitly considered in the context of Tarskian semantic theory are those that reject either:
* The languages have some mechanism allowing self-reference.
* The languages are semantically closed.

The rejection of self-reference produces the Simple Hierarchy of Languages.
The rejection of semantic closure produces the standard Tarskian Hierarchy of Classical Languages.

## Non-classical Hierarchies of Languages
Two other forms of hierarchy are possible but less well defined in the literature:
The hierarchy of non-consistent languages which necessarily concerns those object languages and metalanguages that have either inconsistent or paraconsistent semantics.
The hierarchy of non-classical or non-deductive languages.

We can posit the existence of additional derivable varieties of hierarchies which reject more than one of the four conditions.
