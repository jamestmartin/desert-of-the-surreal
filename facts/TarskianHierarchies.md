# Tarskian Hierarchies of Languages
The hierarchies of languages correspond to a rejection of one or more of the four conditions outlined in Tarski's investigations of the definability of truth:
* The languages or their metalanguage are consistent
* The languages are semantically closed.
* The ordinary (classical) rules of logic hold for the languages.
* The languages have some mechanism allowing self-reference.

## Classical Hierarchies of Languages
In the literature, the two kinds of hierarchy that are explicitly considered in the context of Tarskian semantic theory are those that reject either:
* The languages have some mechanism allowing self-reference.
* The languages are semantically closed.

The rejection of self-reference produces the Simple Hierarchy of Languages.
The rejection of semantic closure produces the standard Tarskian Hierarchy of Classical Languages.

### Simple Hierarchy of Languages
Harris and Zizzi both demonstrate methods of devising systems which have restricted self-reference or have restricted methods of naming that are not quite as drastic as the examples given by Tarski or by Moore.

Lq and its quantum metalanguage are in this hierarchy of langauges.

### Standard Tarskian Hierarchy of Classical Languages
Whatever level of language we attempt to express the structure of the entire hierarchy in, we must concede one of three points: either 

1 the semantics of this level (it may be appropriate to call it "omega") can be "shown" only; no descriptions or definitions can be stated, or 

2 this level is not immune to the semantic contradictions found in the universality of natural language or 

3 some other method of avoiding the contradictions is used.


The first of these options would result in an incomplete science of semantics. It would be an admission that there were some aspects of language (more specifically, certain semantic concepts) incapable of analysis. 

The second option results in the failure to produce a completely consistent science of semantics. This would be an admission that such aspects of language are incapable of avoiding contradiction. 

The third option would effectively eliminate the need for the hierarchy in the first place.

...

The hierarchy of languages cannot itself be constructed within a hierarchy of languages framework.
It cannot prove that it avoids contradictions resulting from semantic concepts, without making use of exactly those semantic concepts which are capable of universality and creating contradictions. Strictly speaking this is not an "internal" inconsistency, but it does indicate a failing of the theory, given the ultimate goals Tarski has for the science of semantics.

## Non-classical Hierarchies of Languages
Two other forms of hierarchy are possible but less well defined in the literature:

* The hierarchy of non-consistent languages which necessarily concerns those object languages and metalanguages that have either inconsistent or paraconsistent semantics or syntax.
* The hierarchy of non-classical or non-deductive languages.
  * Kripke's Theory of Intuitionistic Truth and Transfinite Hierarchy of Deductive Intuitionistic Languages. https://www.impan.pl/~kz/truthseminar/Kripke_Outline.pdf
  * Nelson's Theory of Falsity and Popper's Theory of Refutation.

We can posit the existence of additional derivable varieties of hierarchies which reject more than one of the four conditions.
