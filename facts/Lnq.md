* Multitier entailment
* Complex-valued-degree-preserving entailment
* Real-valued-degree-preserving entailment
* Non-T-Norm Fuzzy Logic, but related to ≈Åukasiewicz T-Norm fuzzy logic.
* Truth-preserving entailment
* Compensatory Fuzzy Logic

* Non-structural with cut.
* EPR cut.
* Non-commutative logic aka order logic.

* Invalidates NC and EM; at least partially paraconsistent and paracomplete.

* Collapses to Basic Sequent Logic with the addition of the exchange structural rule, and reduction of the quantum metalanguage to a classical metalanguage.

* Non-commutative additive conjunction and disjunction
* Degree-preserving non-classical negation
* Non-idempotent multiplicative conjunction and disjunction
* Commutative and non-idempotent exponentials
