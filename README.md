(Thesis) There is a trichotomy between equational theory, computation, and polarity.
(Thesis) There is a dilemma between dependent types, the fire triangle of dependent types, and an interpretation of quantum computation as a hidden-variable theory.
(Thesis) There is a paraconsistent alternative to the metalinguistic hierarchy based on the problems of definability of truth and definability of falsity in paraconsistent systems.

A system is called a paraconsistent system to some degree if it invalidates (or invalidates-by-epislon-degrees) any of the following:
Logic explosion in the object system
Non Contradiction on the right hand side of the turnstile in the object system
Non Contradiction on the left hand side of the turnstile in the object system
(conjectured) Logic explosion in the metasystem
(conjectured) Non Contradiction on the right hand side of the turnstile in the metasystem
(conjectured) Non Contradiction on the left hand side of the turnstile in the metasystem

A system is called a paracomplete system to some degree if it invalidates (or invalidates-by-epislon-degrees) any of the following:
(conjectured) Law of indiscernibles in the object system
Excluded Middle on the right hand side of the turnstile in the object system
Excluded Middle on the left hand side of the turnstile in the object system
(conjectured) Law of indiscernibles in the metasystem
(conjectured) Excluded Middle on the right hand side of the turnstile in the metasystem
(conjectured) Excluded Middle on the left hand side of the turnstile in the metasystem

There exists a complex relationship between paracomplete and paraconsistent systems in terms of their relative duality and polarity with respect to each other.
There exists a complex relationship between paracomplete and paraconsistent systems in terms of their relative (free?) contextuality on the RHS or LHS of sequents.

(Conjecture) Contextuality, duality, and polarity are inter-related to (co)varying degrees.

These complexes of relations are expressed in the squares of oppositions between the sequent systems:
LJ (intuitionistic logic), LDJ (dual intuitionistic logic), coLJ (intuitionistic refutation), and coLDJ (dual intuitonistic refutation).

For each of the systems expressed in the cube of extensions of Sambin's Basic Logic, there exists these squares of oppositions.
(Conjectured) there are generalized polytopes of opposition for each such square of oppositions under paraconsistent or degree preserving entailment systems.
(Conjectured) there exists a kind of hybrid cut which is a combination of a part of cut of proofs and a part of cut of refutations.
(Conjectured) the hybrid cut is related in non-structural or degree-preserving-substructural systems to the EPR cut in Lq.

"But in dependent types, equational inconsistency means that any two types will be equal, which further entails logical inconsistency.
